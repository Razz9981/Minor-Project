     <div id="tb"><p ><b>BHOPAL</b>: India’s seven decades-long wait to see the return of Cheetah in its wild ended  with Prime Minister Narendra Modi releasing the first batch of Cheetahs from Namibia, at  Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh’s Sheopur district on his 72nd Birthday on Saturday. 

        The eight fully-vaccinated Cheetahs <i>(including five females and three males, among them  two male siblings)</i> which were flown from Namibia by special cargo aircraft on Friday  evening, landed at Gwalior Airport at 7.55 am on Saturday. 
        
        After a routine medical check-up, the Cheetahs were shifted in the Indian Air Force’s  Chinook helicopters to the Kuno National Park <i>(KNP)</i>, where the Prime Minister released  three of them from their cages into the special enclosures where they’ll be quarantined  for a month, before being shifted to bigger enclosures for a couple of months and finally  be released in the wild by the year end. 
        “The return of Cheetahs to India marks the full awakening of the country's nature loving  consciousness. But it wouldn’t have been possible without the support and cooperation of India’s friends like Namibia.”

        <p>“The cruel and irresponsible hunting of three last surviving Cheetahs in 1947 in our jungles was reflective of how exploitation and destruction of nature was seen as a show of strength and modernity in the earlier centuries. It is unfortunate that although Cheetah was declared extinct in India in 1952, serious efforts weren’t made for decades for their return and rehabilitation,” PM Modi said. 
            “But in the Amrit Kaal of Azaadi <i>(75th year of India’s independence)</i>, the country has succeeded in Cheetahs return and rehabilitation with full energy. But this day is the result of years of efforts by our experts along with their counterparts from Namibia and South Africa, a development which doesn’t find much importance, if viewed politically,” he maintained. 

            “A comprehensive Cheetah Action Plan was developed by our scientists in association with South African and Namibian counterparts, our scientists went there and there experts came here, after which scientific surveys paved the passage of KNP being selected as ideal habitat for Cheetahs return and rehabilitation.” 
            
            Speaking about the significance of the historic day for the future, the PM said, “Once the Cheetahs start running fast in the jungles of KNP, it will lead to restoration of the grassland ecosystem. Biodiversity and eco-tourism will be enhanced. This will lead to new possibilities of sustainable development in this region, ultimately leading to a rise in productive employment opportunities.” 
            
            The PM, however, appealed to wildlife enthusiasts to show patience and wait for a few months before trouping to KNP for catching the treasured glimpse of the fastest moving animal. “They <i>(Cheetahs)</i> have arrived here as guests, we’ve to give them enough time to make KNP their new and best home. India is working hard to rehabilitate Cheetahs in accordance with international guidelines, we must not allow our efforts to fail.” 
            
            He further said, the return of Cheetahs, again draws home the point that environment for India doesn’t just signify sustainability and security, but it’s also the basis of sensuality and spirituality for us. Our cultural existence since time immemorial has hinged on conservation of environment and wildlife species. 
            
            The message of India of 21st century is that Economy and Ecology aren’t contradictory, but complementary. 
            
            “On the one hand, we’re among the fastest growing economies of the world, but on the other hand rapid progress has been made in the forest and environment front too. Since our government assumed power in 2014, as many as 250 more protected areas have been added, Asiatic Lions numbers have risen sharply, making Gujarat their major habitat. Target of doubling Tiger Count has been achieved before the deadline expires. The number of elephants have risen in the country beyond 30,000 and the great one horn Rhino which was close to extinction too has now grown in numbers in Assam,” the PM said. 
            
            A plan to introduce the big cat in the KNP by November last year had suffered a setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic, officials said. 
            
            After the modified Boeing 747 landed at the Gwalior airbase at 7.47 am, the felines were flown in two Air Force helicopters to Palpur near the Park.</p>

        <h3>About Cheetah!</h3><br><br><br>
        <p style="font-size:20px ;">
            The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, estimated to be capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with the fastest reliably recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h (58 and 61 mph), and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. It typically reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Four subspecies are recognised.
